Certainly! You're asking me to regenerate the previous report, but this time, every Mermaid markdown diagram needs to be enclosed within triple backticks (```) at the beginning and end of the Mermaid code block. This formatting ensures the diagrams render correctly when embedded in a GitHub repository's Markdown file.

I will now proceed with regenerating the report, incorporating this specific formatting requirement for all Mermaid diagrams.
